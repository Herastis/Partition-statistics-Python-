# Partition-statistics (Python)

Create an application that receives a partition as a parameter and analyzes all directories and
files from that partition. At the end, it will display the number of directories and files, the proportion of
each file type (.zip, .exe, etc.) both in number and size. All this information will be
displayed as charts (pie chart, bar chart, etc.).
